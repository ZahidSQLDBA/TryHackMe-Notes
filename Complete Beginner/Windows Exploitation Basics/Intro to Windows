Windows File System and Permissions Explained
-File system keeps data organized
-Logical drives (local disk C), Folders, files
-C drive files and folders:
Perflogs: stores the system issues and other reports regarding performance
Program Files and Program Files (x86): location where programs install
Users: stored user information and data
Windows: contains the code to run the OS and some utility tools
-File Permissions:
can be set by admin or privileged account
applied to users and groups
-Types of permissions
Full Control: allows user/users/group/groups to set ownership of the folder, set permission for others, modify, read, write and execute files
Modify: modify, read, write and execute files
Read & execute: read and execute files
List folder contents: list the contents (files, subfolders) of a folder
Read: only read
Write: write data to the specified folder.

Set permissions: right click on file folder > properties > security > edit > permission for user > Apply
CMD - use tool "icalcs"
Designations: 
I - inherited from parent container
F - Full access
M - Modify
OI - object inherit
IO - inherit only
CI - contaier inherit
RX - read and execute
AD - Append data (add subdirectories)
WD - write data and add files

Authentication
-Process of verifying the identity of a person (object or service)
-Local Auth: done using LSA
LSA: Local Security Authority - keeps track of the security policies and the accounts that are on a computer system
-Types of Active Directory: controls user access once logged on to a network
1. On-premise:
-has record of all users, PCs and Servers 
-protocols: NTLM, LDAP/LDAPS, KERBEROS
NTLM: uses a challenge-response sequence of messages between client and server system.
-NTLM provides authentication based on a challenge-response authentication scheme
-NTLM does not provide data integrity or data confidentiality protection
LDAP/LDAPS: supports encryption, credentials are not sent in plain text
-Domain Controller can be considered a database of users, groups, computers and so on
-user's workstation using an API to the domain controller to validate and log in
Kerberos: uses symmetric-key cryptography
-requires a trusted 3d party
2. Azure:
-secure online authentication store
-contains users and groups
-supports SAML, OAUTH 2.0, OpenID Connect
SAML: Security Assertion Markup Language
-single sign-on standard
-defines a set of rules/protocols that allow users to access web apps with single login
-Service providers: systems and applications that user accesses throughout the day
-Identity providers: system that performs user auth
OAUTH 2.0: Standard that apps use to provide client applications with access
-authorization server: issues access token
-resouce owner grants permission to access the resource server with an access token
-client passes it to the resouce server
-resource server accepts the access token and must verify that it is valid 
OpenID Connect: auth standard built on top of OAUTH 2.0
-adds an additional token called an ID token
-uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
-user authentication
