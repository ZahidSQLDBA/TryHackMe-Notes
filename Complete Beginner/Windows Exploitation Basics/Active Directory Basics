Pysical Active Directory: servers and machines on-premise, domain-controllers, storage servers 
-everything needed for active direcotry environment except software
Domain Controllers: windows server that has active directory domain service (AD DS) installed
-center of active directory
tasks of a domain controller:
-holds the AD DS data store
-handles authentication and authorization
-replicate updates from other domain controllers in the forest
-allow admin access to manage domain resources
AD DS Data Store
-holds the databases and processes needed to store and manage directory information 
-directory information: users, groups and services
-contains the NTDS.dit: database that contains all the information of an Active Directory domain controller as well as pw hashes for domain users
-stored by default in %SystemRoot%\NTDS
-accessible only by the domain controller

The Forest
-collection of one or more domain trees inside of an Active directory network
-Parts of the forest
Trees: A hierarchy of domains in Active Directory Domain Services
Domains: used to group and manage objects
Organizational Units(OUs): containers for groups, computers, users, printers and other OUs
Trusts: Allow users to access resources in other domains
Objects: user, group, printers, computers, shares
Domain Service: DNS Server, LLMNR, IPv6
Domain Schema: Rules for object creation

Users + Groups
-Users: core to Active Directory
-types of users:
1. Domain Admins: control domains and are the only ones with access to the domain controller
2. Service Accounts: used for service maintenance, required by windows for services such as SQL to pair a service with a service account
3. Local Admins: users can make changes to local machines, can't access domain controller
4. Domain users: everyday users, may have local administrator rights to machines depending on the organization
Groups: makes it easier to give permissions to users and objects by organizing them into groups with specified permissions
-Security Groups: used to specify permissions for a large number of users
-Distribution Groups: specify email distribution lists (beneficial in enumeration)
-Default security groups:
Domain controllers: all domain controllers in the domain
Domain guests: all domain guests
Domain users: all domain users
Domain computers: all workstations and servers joind to the domain
Domain admins: designated administrators of the domain
Enterprise admins: designated administrators of the enterprise
Schema admins: designated adminstators of schema
DNS admins: DNA administators group
DNS update proxy: DNS clients who are permitted to perform dynamic updates on behalf of some other client (DHCP servers)
