Key Terms
Plaintext: Data before encryption or hashing, often text but could be photo or other file
Encoding: a form of data representation like base64 or hexadecimal. Immediately reversible
Hash: output of a hash function
Brute Force: attacking cyptography by trying every combination of values from a given list
Cyptanalysis: attacking cryptography by fiding a weakness in the underlying maths

Hash Function
-Impossible or extremely difficult to go back from output back to input
-takes data of any size
-creates a summary of data
-output is a fixed size
-good hashing function are fast to compute and slow to reverse
-small change in input results in extremely different result in output
-pw verification uses hashing

Hash Collision
-when 2 different inputs give the same output
-Pigeonhole effect is given there are a set number of different outputs, if there are more inputs than outputs, some inputs must give the same output
-MD5 and SHA1 are technically insecure due to hash collisions separately
-MD5 collision: https://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/md5collision/
-SHA1 collision: https://shattered.io/
