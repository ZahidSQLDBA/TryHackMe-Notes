Key Terms
Ciphertext - The result of encrypting a plaintext, encrypted data
Cipher - A method of encrypting or decrypting data. Modern ciphers are cryptographic, but there are many non cryptographic ciphers like Caesar.
Plaintext - Data before encryption, often text but not always. Could be a photograph or other file
Encryption - Transforming data into ciphertext, using a cipher.
Encoding - NOT a form of encryption, just a form of data representation like base64. Immediately reversible.
Key - Some information that is needed to correctly decrypt the ciphertext and obtain the plaintext.
Passphrase - Separate to the key, a passphrase is similar to a password and used to protect a key.
Asymmetric encryption - Uses different keys to encrypt and decrypt.
Symmetric encryption - Uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt
Brute force - Attacking cryptography by trying every different password or every different key
Cryptanalysis - Attacking cryptography by finding a weakness in the underlying maths
Alice and Bob - Used to represent 2 people who generally want to communicate. Theyâ€™re named Alice and Bob because this gives them the initials A and B. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob for more information, as these extend through the alphabet to represent many different people involved in communication.
-SSH keys are protected with a passphrase

Encryption
-crytography is used to protect confidentiality and ensure integrity and authenticity
-sensitive user data need to encrypted
-PCI-DSS standard: data should be in storage and during transmission

Crucial Cypto Maths
-Modulo Operator: x % y is the remainder of x / y
eg: 25 % 5 = 0 (remainder is 0)
eg: 23 % 5 = 3 (remainder is 3)
eg: 23 % 6 = 5 (remainder is 5)
-modulo is not reversible because infinite values 
x % 5 = 4

Types of Encryption
1. Symmetric: uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data
-DES: 56 bits long - broken
-AES: 128 and 256 bit long
2. Asymmetric: uses a pair of keys, one to encrypt and the other to decrypt, private and public keys
-RSA - 2048 to 4096 bit keys
-Elliptic Curve
*private keys need to be private
Triple DES - result of the attempt to make DES more secure so that it could be used for longer
