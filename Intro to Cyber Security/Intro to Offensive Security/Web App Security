What do you need to access a web application: browser

Web App security risks

1. Identification and Authentication Failure
-allowing multiple log in attempts (brute force)
-allowing week passwords (easy to guess)
-storing passwords in plain text

2. Broken Access Control
-failing to apply the priciple of least privilege (giving more acces to users than they need)
-being able to view or modify another account
-being able to view pages without authentication

3. Injection
-insertion of malicious code as input (poor sanitization of input)

4. Cryptographic failures
-lack of encryption (sending datat in clear text - HTTP instead of HTTPS)
-weak cryptographic algorithm

Practical Examples of Web App Security
-IDOR: Insecure direct object references
