1. Prevent intrusions
2. Detect intrusions when they occur and respond effectively

Tasks:
1. Awareness: protect against various types of attacks
2. Doumentation and management of assets: manage and protect devices and systems
3. Updating and Patching: ensure devices are updated and patched for any known vulns
4. Set up preventative measures: setup firewall and intrusion systems
5. Set up logging and monitoring devices: detection of malicious activity 

SOC (Security Operation Center)
-team of cyber security professionals that monitor the network and its systems to detect malicious events
-Areas of interest: vulnerabilites, policy violations, unauthorized activity, network intrusions

Threat intelligence
-information gathered about actual and potential enemies
-a threat: any action that can disrupt or adversely affect a system
-purpose: achieve a threat-informed defense
-advesaries vary depending on the company or target
-data is gathered, processed and analyzed 

DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response)
Digital Forensics: analysis of evidence of an attack and attackers in areas such as intellectual property theft, cyber espionage, possession of unauthorized content
-file system: system storage, installed programs, created files, partially overwritten files and deleted files
-system memory: information stored in memory without being saved to the disk
-system logs: look of evidence in system log files
-network logs: evidence stored in network packets

Incident Response: following a data breach or cyber attack, this methodology is used to reduce damage and recover in the shortest time possible
Four major phases of incident response
1. Preparation: team trained to handle incidents
2. Detection and Analysis: use resources and tools to access severity of incident
3. Containtement: stop incident from affecting other systems, eliminate cause and recover affected systems
4. Post-Incident Activity: report is produced and lessons are learned for future incidents

Malware Analysis
-Malicious software: Viruses, Trojan Horse, Ransomware
-Malware analysis: learn about malicious software
1. static analysis: inspect the malicious program without running it 
2. dynamic analysis: inspect the malicious program by running in it in a controlled environment
