MISP - Malware information sharing platform

MISP(Malware information sharing platform): open-source threat information that facilitates the collection, storage and distribution of threat intelligence and IOC
-open source

Use cases:
1. malware reverse engineering: understand how different malware familiess function
2. security investigations
3. intelligence analysis
4. law enforcement: support forensic investigations
5. risk analysis: research new threats
6. fraud analysis

Supports:
1. IOC database
2. Automatic correlation
3. Data sharing
4. Import & export features
5. Event graph
6. API support

Terms: 
Events: Collection of contextually linked information.
Attributes: Individual data points associated with an event, such as network or system indicators.
Objects: Custom attribute compositions.
Object References: Relationships between different objects.
Sightings: Time-specific occurrences of a given data point or attribute detected to provide more credibility.
Tags: Labels attached to events/attributes.
Taxonomies: Classification libraries are used to tag, classify and organise information.
Galaxies: Knowledge base items used to label events/attributes.
Indicators: Pieces of information that can detect suspicious or malicious cyber activity.

Use: 
-launch machine
-login

Event management
-create all malware investigation correlations by providing descriptions and attributes
-Event creation, populating events with attributes and attachments, publishing
-distrubution options: 4
-user role to publish events: organisation admin

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feeds
-resources that contain indicators that can be imported into MISP
-feeds provide analysts and orgs with continuously updated info on threats and adversaries

Taxonomies
-classifying information based on standard features or attributes
-three parts
1. namespace: defines the tag's property to be used
2. predicate: specifies the property attached to the data
3. value: numerical or text details to map the property

Tagging
-allows for effective sharing of threat information b/n users, communities and organizations.
-must-have tags:
1. traffic light protocol: colour schema to guide how intelligence can be shared
2. confidence: provides and indication as to whether or not the data being shared is high quality and vetted
3. origin: source of information, automation or manual investigation
4. permissible actions protocol: advanced classification that indicates how data can be used
