Windows Domains
-a group of users and computers under the administration of a given business
Active Directory (AD)
-certalize the administration of common components of a windows computer network in a single repo
Domain controller (DC)
-The server that runs the active direcotry services

Centralized identity management: all users across the network can be configured from active directory with min effort
Managing security policies: can configure security policies directly from the active direcotry and apply them to users and computers across the network as needed


In a Windows domain, credentials are stored in a centralised repository called...
-Active Directory

The server in charge of running the Active Directory services is called...
-Domain Controller

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Active Directory Domain Service (AD DS)
-catalogue that holds the information of all the objects that exist on the network

Users - one of the objects - security principals - authenticated by the domain and can be assigned privileges over resources. Two entities
People: persons in the organization
Services: users used by services - only have privileges needed to run their specific service

Machines - every computer that joins the AD domain
-machine accounts are themselves local adminis
-passwords: 120 random characters
-account name: computer name  + dollar sign: DC01$

Security Groups
-user groups assigned access to rights
-better managebility
Domain Admins	 - Users of this group have administrative privileges over the entire domain. By default, they can administer any computer on the domain, including the DCs.
Server Operators -	Users in this group can administer Domain Controllers. They cannot change any administrative group memberships.
Backup Operators -	Users in this group are allowed to access any file, ignoring their permissions. They are used to perform backups of data on computers.
Account Operators -	Users in this group can create or modify other accounts in the domain.
Domain Users -	Includes all existing user accounts in the domain.
Domain Computers -	Includes all existing computers in the domain.
Domain Controllers -	Includes all existing DCs on the domain.

Builtin: Contains default groups available to any Windows host.
Computers: Any machine joining the network will be put here by default. You can move them if needed.
Domain Controllers: Default OU that contains the DCs in your network.
Users: Default users and groups that apply to a domain-wide context.
Managed Service Accounts: Holds accounts used by services in your Windows domain.

Organizational units: used to group users together so that policies can be applied consistently the users within the group

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Managing uses in AD

-delegation: give specific user some control over some OUs

flag: THM{thanks_for_contacting_support}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Managing Computers in AD

1. Workstations: most common - not privileged user
2. Servers: second most common - provide service to users or other servers
3. Domain Controllers: third most common - manage AD domain (most sensitive - contain hashed pw)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Group Policies
-GPO(Group Policy Objects) - collection of settings that can be applied to OUs
-linked to OUs
-security filtering to GPO to be applied to only specific users
-Settings > includes actual contents of the GPO
-right click and edit
-change min password length

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Authentication Methods
-credentials are stored in the domain controllers
-when user attempts to authenticate, it needs to be verified by the domain controller
-two protocols are used: 
1. Kerberos: default
2. NetNTLM: legacy

1. Kerberos Authentication
-default for any recent version of Windows
-assigned tickets - proof of previous authentication
-steps:
A. User sends username and key(derived from pw) to Key Distribution Center (KDC)
B. KDC will create and send back Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT - allows user to request additional tickets)
C. KDC will send Additional Session Key to the user
*TGT is encrypted using krbtgt
D. User uses TGT to request Ticket Granting Service (TGS) to access network, website or database
E. User also sends username, timestamp and service principal name (SPN) - sevice and server name to access
F. KDC will send User a TGS and Service session key
*TGS is encrypted using Service owner hash
G. TGS + Username and timestamp: sent to desired service to authenticate and establish connection

2. NetNTLM Authentication
A. Client sends an authentication request to server
B. Server generates a random number and sends it as a challenge to the client
C. Client combines NTLM password hash with challenge to generate a response and send back to server
D. Server forwards challenge and resopnse to Domain controller
E. Domain controller recalculates the correct response with client response and generates allow or deny authentication
F. Server forwards authentication result to client
* user pw is not transmitted through the network for security

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Trees
-two domains that share the same namespace can be jointed into a Tree
eg. thm.local could be split into uk.thm.local and us.thm.local
-enterprise admins group will grant user administrative privileges over all of an enterprise's domains

Forests
-additional domains can be added into a forest
eg. merge with another company

-Trees and forests allow for compartmentalized network in terms of management and resources
-allow the authorization of a user from one domain to another domain
-could be one-way or two-way trust relationships
