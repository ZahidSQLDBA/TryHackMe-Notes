The Creeper Program

Von Neumann architecture  - computer transfer data to hardware - produced work  detailing self-replicating computer programs

Creeper:
-worm/virus - first-ever virus to be created written by Bob Thomas in 1971
-used ARPANET (Advanced Research projects Agency Network) to transfer itself b/n computers 
-created using PDP-10 Assembly programming language
-operating system: TENEX
-removed older copies of itself before transferring to the next computer
-redesigned by Ray Tomlinson (doesn't delete copies before transferring)
Arpanet:
-Remote login protocol and transferring files protocol
-Network control program: computers being able to communicate within networks (Network working group)
-packet switching: breaking data into packets to then route or send said data to the receiver. The receiver will reassemble packets back into original file (still used today)

Reaper:
-created by Ray Tomlinson
-Resource-sharing capability - RSEXEC
-Malware.wiki: nematode -removes other malware => First Anti-virus software

Wabbit:
-1974 - Elmer Fudd reference
-one of the first self-replicating malware
-chokes the system on its resources and ends up crashing
-considered the first malicious program
-infect the machine it was put on but did not pass via a network - not classed as a worm
-form of DOS (Denial-of-service) - "Fork Bomb"
-Works by creating an infinite loop that continually creates system processes and copies of the original file
-create high number of cpu cycles - constipates the system and consumes system resources until crash
-worked on system framework IBM OS
