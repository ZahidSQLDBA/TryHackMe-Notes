The Creeper Program

Von Neumann architecture  - computer transfer data to hardware - produced work  detailing self-replicating computer programs

Creeper:
-worm/virus - first-ever virus to be created written by Bob Thomas in 1971
-used ARPANET (Advanced Research projects Agency Network) to transfer itself b/n computers 
-created using PDP-10 Assembly programming language
-operating system: TENEX
-removed older copies of itself before transferring to the next computer
-redesigned by Ray Tomlinson (doesn't delete copies before transferring)
Arpanet:
-Remote login protocol and transferring files protocol
-Network control program: computers being able to communicate within networks (Network working group)
-packet switching: breaking data into packets to then route or send said data to the receiver. The receiver will reassemble packets back into original file (still used today)

Reaper:
-created by Ray Tomlinson
-Resource-sharing capability - RSEXEC
-Malware.wiki: nematode -removes other malware => First Anti-virus software

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wabbit:
-1974 - Elmer Fudd reference
-one of the first self-replicating malware
-chokes the system on its resources and ends up crashing
-considered the first malicious program
-infect the machine it was put on but did not pass via a network - not classed as a worm
-form of DOS (Denial-of-service) - "Fork Bomb"
-Works by creating an infinite loop that continually creates system processes and copies of the original file
-create high number of cpu cycles - constipates the system and consumes system resources until crash
-worked on system framework IBM OS

Animal
-1975 the first trojan created by John Walker
-Asks user a number of questions to guess the type of animal they were thing of (20 questions game)
-while the user plays, a subroutine "PERVADE" created a copy of itself and ANIMAL in every directory that the user has access to
-spread across UNIVAC(universal automatic computer)

Elk Cloner
-1982 microcomputer viruses - Richard Skrenta
-attached to Apple II OS and spread via floppy disk
-technique: "boot sector virus" - program placed into a game's code - game started on the 50th time activated the virus instead of launching game
-created a blank screen a displayed a poem about the virus
-spread from infected floppy disks -> virus placed in computer memory -> spread to uninfected floppy discs when inserted
-Accidental harm to Apple DOS disks (malware)
-Boot Sector Viruses: infect boot sector(starts the computer)

The Morris Internet Worm
-1988 Robert Tappan Morris
-a worm that was suppposed to highlight security flaws of academic networks 
-failed to check which computers it had already been to - DOS and Fork Bomb
-arrested on a felony conviction in the US under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
-Worm spread by exploiting known vulnerabilities in Unix Sendmail, rsh(remote shell)/rexec and weak passwords
-infected 2000 computers within 15 hours - took 2 days to get off a single computer
-6000 computers were infected (10% of the internet)
-Berkeley r-commands: access computers with weak passwords, designed for UNIX (early implementation of TCP/IP)

Cascade
-first type to use a form of encryption
-encryption used to keep program undetected
-infected .com file extensions
-tried to avoid IBM OS Framework
-40 different varients
-checks file size, infected files would have a much larger size (1704 bytes more in most variants)
-mutations in code for different abilites
-payload activted on October 1st and December 31st
-The DOS malware would make text fall from the screen until a heap of characters were at the bottom
