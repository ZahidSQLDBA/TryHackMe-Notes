Malware Campaigns

Targeted
-created for a specific purpose
-example: DarkHotel Malware (https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/resource-center/threats/darkhotel-malware-virus-threat-definition)

Mass Campaign
-most common
-purpose is to infect as many devices as possible
-example: Crouching Yeti(Energetic Bear) campaign (https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/resource-center/threats/crouching-yeti-energetic-bear-malware-threat)

Stuxnet is a computer worm that was originally aimed at Iran's nuclear facilities
Wannacry is a ransomware that used the Eternalblue exploit in a "Mass Campaign" attack

Identifying a Malware attack happened

-Malware is largely obstrusive - it leaves an extensive trail of evidence
-Malware attack process
1. Delivery - (USB, PDF attachements etc)
2. Execution - (Encryption-Ransomeware, record info such as keystrokes-Spyware etc)
3. Maintaining Persistence (not always) - noisy stage - make sure "execution" is worth its while
4. Propagation (not always) - spread to other devices
-steps generate lots of data
-network traffic, system interaction read/writes and modifications
-Malware is classified based on behaviours
-Host Based Signatures: results of execution and persistence performed by malware
-Network Based signatures: any network communication taking plae during delivery,execution and propagation

Static vs. Dynamic Analysis

Static Analysis
-gain high-level abstraction of the sample
-analysis of sample at the state it presents itself as without executing code
-techniques such as signature analysis via checksums - quick, efficient/brief and safe 

Dynamic Analysis
-involves executing sample and observing what happens
-could be harmful to computer and network
