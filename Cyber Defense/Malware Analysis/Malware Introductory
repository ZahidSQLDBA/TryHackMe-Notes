Identifying a Malware attack happened

-Malware is largely obstrusive - it leaves an extensive trail of evidence
-Malware attack process
1. Delivery - (USB, PDF attachements etc)
2. Execution - (Encryption-Ransomeware, record info such as keystrokes-Spyware etc)
3. Maintaining Persistence (not always) - noisy stage - make sure "execution" is worth its while
4. Propagation (not always) - spread to other devices
-steps generate lots of data
-network traffic, system interaction read/writes and modifications
-Malware is classified based on behaviours
-Host Based Signatures: results of execution and persistence performed by malware
-Network Based signatures: any network communication taking plae during delivery,execution and propagation
