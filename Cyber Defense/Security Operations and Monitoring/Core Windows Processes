Task Manager: build in GUI based windows utility
-allows users to see what is running on the windows system
-information on resource usage

Task manager
5 tabs: Processes, Performance, Users, Details, Services

Processes Types:
-Apps
-Background Processes
-Windows processes
Columns of processes
-Publisher: name of the author
-PID: process identifier number (unique identifier when program starts)
-command line: full command used to launch process
-CPU: ammount of CPU used
-Memory: amount of physical working memory used by process

Details:
-add image path name
-add command line
-match PID with type of process with image path and command line, look for anomalies

Process Hacker
-System Process: ID 4 open in kernel mode
user mode: process provides application with their own virtual address space
-each application runs in isolation 
-crash only affects that specific application
-one application can not alter the data of another
Kernel mode: a single virtual address space
-a kernal mode driver is not isolated from other drivers
-can compromise other driver data
-crash affects the entire OS

-properties:
-verified Microsoft Windows
-parent

System > smss.exe
-Session Manager Subsystem: responsible for creating new sessions
-starts the kernel mode(win32k.sys) and user mode (winsrv.dll) of windows subsystem
-smss.exe starts csrss.exe(windows subsystem) and wininit.exe in session 0
-crss.exe and winlogon.exe for session 1 - user session

Two processes does smss.exe start in session 1: csrss.exe, winlogon.exe

csrss.exe(client server runtime process): user-mode side of Windows subsystem
-critical
-if terminated results in system failure
-responsible for Win32 console window and process thread creation and deletion
(csrsrv.dll, basesrv.dll, and winsrv.dll)

-process which had PID 384 and PID 488? smss.exe

-----------------------------------------------------

Windows initialization process: wininit.exe - responsible for launching services.exe(service control manager)
and local security authority (lsass.exe) and credential guard and key guard (lsaiso.exe)
-cricial windows process that runs in the background
What is unusual?
-An actual parent process. (smss.exe calls this process and self-terminates)
-Image file path other than C:\Windows\System32
-Subtle misspellings to hide rogue process in plain sight
-Multiple running instances
-Not running as SYSTEM

----------------------------------------------------------

service control manager (SCM) - services.exe
-responsible for handling system services
-loading services
-starting and ending services
-maintains a database that can be queried using Windows built-in utility 'sc.exe'
-loads device drivers marked as auto-satrt into memory
-uses Last Known Good Configuration (HKLM\System\Select\LastKnownGood)
-parent to (svchost.exe, spoolsv.exe, msmpeng.exe, dllhost.exe)
What is unusual?
-parent process other than wininit.exe
-Image file path other than C:\Windows\System32
-subtle misspellings
-multiple running instances
-not running as system

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Service host - svchost.exe
-responsible for hosting managing windows services
-implemented as DLLs
-DLL to implement is stored in the registry for the service under the parameters subkey in ServiceDLL
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SERVICE NAME\Parameters

services > properties > binary path
-key idenifier -k 
-legitimate svchost.exe process
-k paramerter is for grouping simi;ar service to share the same process
-design implemented to reduce resouce consumption

svchost.exe will always have multiple running processes
-adversaries create malware to masquerade as this process and hide amongst the legitimate svchost.exe processes
-another tactic is to install/call a malicious service (DLL)
-svchost.exe abuse: https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/2015/12/18/the-typographical-and-homomorphic-abuse-of-svchost-exe-and-other-popular-file-names/

Normal: runs from C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe

Unusual:
-parent process other than services.exe
-image file path other than C:\Windows\System32
-subitle misspellings
-absence of the -k parameter

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

lsass.exe
-local security authority subsystem service (LSASS)
-responsible for enforcing the security policy on the system
-verifies user log in 
-handles password changes
-creates user tokens
-also writes to the Windows Security Log
-creates token for SAM(Security Account Manager), AD (Active Directory), and NETLOGON
Registry Editor: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa
-another process targeted by tools such as mimikatz
-mimikatz: used to dump credentials or mimic process to hide in plain sight
LSASS: https://yungchou.wordpress.com/2016/03/14/an-introduction-of-windows-10-credential-guard/

Normal:
-System32\lsass.exe
-parent: wininit.exe
-1 instance
-user account: Local system
-starts within seconds of boot time

Unusual:
-parent other than wininit.exe
-file path other than C:\Windows\System32
-subtle misspelling
-multiple instances
-not running as system
