Sysmon: System Monitor
-remains resident across system reboots to monitor and log system activity to the windows event log
-detailed info about process creation, newtwork connections and changes to file creation time
-SIEM: identify malicious or anomalous activity and understand how intruders and malware operate on network
-starts in windows boot process
-stored: Appications and Services Logs/Microsoft/Windows/Sysmon/Operational

Sysmon config
-requires a config file to tell the binary how to analyze the events that it is receiving
-example: https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config
-24 different types of Event IDs
-excludes normal events

Event ID 1: Process Creation
-look for any created processes
-look for known suspicious processes or processes with typos
-use CommandLine and Image XML tags
Event ID 3: Network Connection
-look for events that occured remotely
-look for files and sources of suspicious binaries and opened ports
-use Image and DestinationPort XML tags
Event ID 7: Image Loaded
-look ofr DLLs loaded by processes
-useful for DLL injection and DLL hijacking attacks
-use image, signed, imageLoaded and signature XML tags
Event ID 8: Create Remote Thread
-monitor for processes injecting code into other processes
-used by legitimate tasks and apps 
-could also be used by malware to hide malicious activity
-use SourceImage, TargetImage, StartAddress and StartFunction XML tags
Event ID 11: File Created
-logs events when files are created or overwritten the endpoint
-use TargetFileName XML tags
Event ID 12/13/14: Registry Event
-look for modifications to the registry
-eg: malicious activity - persistence and credential abuse
-use TargetObject XML tags
Event ID 15: FileCreateStreamHash
-look for an alternate data stream
-used to hide malware
-use TargetFilename XML tags
Event ID 22: DNS Event
-log all DNS queries and events for analysis
-exclude all trusted domains
-look for DNS anomalies
-use QueryName XML tags

Installing and Preparing Sysmon
PowerShell command: Download-SysInternalsTools C:\Sysinternals
config SwiftOn Security: https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config
config ION-Storm: https://github.com/ion-storm/sysmon-config/blob/develop/sysmonconfig-export.xml

Starting Sysmon
Sysmon.exe -accepteula -i sysmonconfig-export.xml

Cutting out the noise

-Normal activity - 'noise' needs to be filtered out with Sysmon
-focus on suspicious activites
-use of ample and efficient configuration file to do the heavy lifting

Best practices
-Excluding events is better than including events
-CLI offeres better control: use Get-WinEvent or wevutil.exe
-Know your environment before implementation- understanding what is suspicious to better craft rules

Filtering events with Event Viewer
-filtering with EventID and Keywords
Filter menu > Filter Current Log

Filtering Events with Powershell
-Get-WinEvent along with XPath queries
-wevutil.exe
-filter by Event Id: */System/EventID=<ID>
-filter by XML Attribute/Name: */EventData/Data[@Name="<XML Attribute/Name>"]
-filter by Event Data: */EventData/Data=<Data>

example: Get-WinEvent -Path <Path to Log> -FilterXPath '*/System/EventID=3 and */EventData/Data[@Name="DestinationPort"] and */EventData/Data=4444'

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hunting Metasploit
-commonly used exploit framework
-default metasploit port is 4444

Get-WinEvent -Path  <Path to Log> -FilterXPath '*/System/EventID=3 and */EventData/Data[@Name="DestinationPort"] and */EventData/Data=4444'
-filter for eventId 3 (network connection)
-and port number 4444
