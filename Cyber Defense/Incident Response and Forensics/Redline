2. Comprehensive: most data, 1hr + 
3. IOC Search: data matching IOCs (created with help of IOC editor) - Indicators of Compromise

Runredlineaudit.bat: script run to initiate data collection process
Disk enumeration: collect the data on disk an volumes
prefetch: windows cache for recently executed code

Redline interface

System information: info about the machine, BIOS (windows), OS, USER info
Processes: Process name, PID, Path, Arguments, Parent processes, username etc

A handle: connection from a process to an object/resource in Windows OS
-reference internal objects like file, reg keys, resources etc

Memory Sections: investigate unsigned memory sections used by some processes
-most processes use legitimate dynamic link libraries (DLLs) - which will be signed
-unsigned DLLs are worth taking a closer look

Strings: captured strings

Ports: Malware initiates outbound or inbound connections to communicate to (C2 - command and control server)
-review suspicious connections from  ports and IP addresses
-could hide under system processes

Timeline: help better understand when the compromise happened
-record of every action on file creation, change, modification and access
