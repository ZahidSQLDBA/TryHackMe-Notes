Two categories (single and staged)

see Meterpreter versions using msfvenom
'msfvenom --list payloads | grep meterpreter'
list of Android, Apple iOS, Java, Linux, OSX, PHP, Phyton, Windows versions
-important factors for version choice
1. Target OS
2. Components available on target system (Phython? PHP website? etc)
3. Network connection types (TCP, HTTPS, etc)

some exploits have default meterpreter payload 
-can be listed by 'show payloads'

Meterpreter three primary categories of tools
1. Built-in commands
2. Meterpreter tools
3. Meterpreter scripting

-core commands:
background: Backgrounds the current session
exit: Terminate the Meterpreter session
guid: Get the session GUID (Globally Unique Identifier)
help: Displays the help menu
info: Displays information about a Post module
irb: Opens an interactive Ruby shell on the current session
load: Loads one or more Meterpreter extensions
migrate: Allows you to migrate Meterpreter to another process

route: Allows you to view and modify the routing table

-system commands:
clearev: Clears the event logs
execute: Executes a command
getpid: Shows the current process identifier
getuid: Shows the user that Meterpreter is running as
kill: Terminates a process
pkill: Terminates processes by name
ps: Lists running processes
reboot: Reboots the remote computer
shell: Drops into a system command shell
shutdown: Shuts down the remote computer
sysinfo: Gets information about the remote system, such as OS

-other commands:
idletime: Returns the number of seconds the remote user has been idle

Post Exploitation with Meterpreter
'getuid' - possible privilege level on the target system
'ps' - list running processes

Migrate to another process will help meterpreter interact with it
if word.exe or notepad.exe is running, it is migrated to meterpreter and start capturing keystrokes
'keyscan_start', 'keyscan_stop', 'keyscan_dump' - keylogger commands

'hashdump' - command will list the content of SAM (security account manager) database - stores user's passwords on windows systems
NTLM(New Technology LAN Manager) format

'search' - useful to locate files with important information
'shell' - launch a regular command-line shell on target system
