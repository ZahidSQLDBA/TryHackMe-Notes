Metasploit: widely used exploitation framework.
-powerfull tool that can support all phases of a penetration testing engagement
-two versions:
1. Metasploit Pro: commercial version (automation and management with GUI)
2. Metasploit Framework: open-source in CLI
-set of tools for information gathering, scanning, exploitation, exploit development, post-exploitation and more
-main components:
1. msfconsole: main command line interface
2. modules: supporting modules such as exploits, scanners, payloads etc
3. tools: stand-alone tools that will help vulnerability research, vulnerability assessment, or pen testing (msfvenom, pattern_create and patter_offset)

Exploit: piece of code that uses a vulnerability present on the target system
Vulnerability: a design, coding or logic flaw affecting a target system
Payload: code that will run on the target system

modules and categories
-Auxillary: any supporting module, such as scanners, crawlers and fuzzers
-Encoders: encode exploit and payload such that it avoid signature based antivirus
-Evasion: evade antivirus software
-Exploits: exploits organized by target system
-NOPs: No Operation, cpu will do nothing for one cycle, used as buffer to achieve consistent payload sizes
-Payloads: getting a shell, loading malware or backdoor to target system, running a command or launching calc.exe. Three categories:
1. Singles: self-contained payloads, don't need additional component to run
2. Stagers: set up connecion b/n metasploit and target system. staged payloads will upload a stager to the target system then download the rest of the payload (stage).Inital size of the payload will be relatively small compared to full payload sent at once
3. Stages: downloaded by stager, use larger sized payloads

run metasploit
1. msfconsole - msf6 command line 
-can be used just like a regular command-line shell
-does not support output redirection
-autocomplete
-modules to be used are selected using 'use' command
-'show' command followed by module type (auxiliary, payload, exploit, etc.)
-'back' command
-'info' command
