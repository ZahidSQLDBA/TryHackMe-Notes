Automated vs Manual Vulnerability Research
-vulnerability scanners are convenient means of quickly canvassing an application for flaws
eg: Nessus (Community and Commercial versions)
-Advantages of using a Vulnerability Scanner
1. easy to repeat and share within a team
2. quick and numerous tests run efficiently
3. open-source solutions are available
4. cover wide range that may be hard to manually search
-Disadvantages of using a Vulnerability Scanner
1. too reliant on tools
2. extremely "loud" with lots of traffic and logging, trigger firewalls
3. licenses required for commercial uses
4. often don't find every vulnerability on an application
-Vuln scanners
1. Security misconfigurations: due to developer oversight(eg. explosed server info)
2. Broken access control: attacker can access parts of an app they are not supposed to have access
3. Insecure Deserialization: insecure processing of data sent across an application
4. Injection: attacker is able to input malicious data into an app(poor sanitization of input)

Finding Manual Exploits
-Rapid7: vuln research database
-GitHub: host and share source code-security researchers store and share proff of concept (keyword "cve")
-searchsploit: offline copy of exploit-db

Example of Manual Exploitation
-Foothold: access to the vulnerable machine's console, possible to exploit other apps or machines on the network
