Vulnerability: weakness or flaw in the design, implementation or behavior of a system or application
-an attacker can exploit these weaknesses to gain access to unauthorized information or perform unauthorized actions
Five Categories
1. Operating System: result in privilege escalation
2. (Mis)Configuration: incorrectly configured app or service
3. Weak or Default credentials: easy to guess by an attacker to gain authentication
4. Application Logic: poorly designed applications
5. Human-Factor: leverage human behavior

Vulnerability management: process of evaluating, categorising and ultimately remediating threats
-2% of vulnerabilities end up being exploited(Kenna security., 2020)
-address the most dangerous vulnerabilites and reduce likelihood of an attack vector
Vulnerability scoring: used to determine the potential risk and impact a vulnerability may have on a network or computer system
Common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS): awards points to a vuln based upon its features, availability and reproducibility
-introduced 2005
-score ranges:
Rating			Score
None			0
Low			0.1 - 3.9
Medium			4.0 - 6.9
High			7.0 - 8.9
Critical		9.0 - 10.0
-CVSS advantages:
1. Long time usage
2. Free framework
3. recommended by organizations such as NIST
-CVSS disadvantages
1. only designed to assign a value of severity
2. assesses vulns based on an exploit being available(only 20% vulns have an exploit available(Tenable., 2020)
3. vulns rarely change scoring after assessment despite new developments

Vulnerability Prority Rating(VPR)
-modern framework
-risk-driven, rating with focus on the risk a vuln poses to organization itself
-takes account the relevancy of a vulnerability
-same catagories as CVSS but no "informational or none" category
-VPR advantages:
1. modern framework
2. considers over 150 factors 
3. risk-driven to help orgs prioritize patching vulns
4. scoring is dynamic
-VPR disadvantages:
1. not open-source
2. can only be adopted aprt of a commercial platform
3. does not consider CIA triad to the extent of CVSS
