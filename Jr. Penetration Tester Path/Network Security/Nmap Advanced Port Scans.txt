1. Null Scan
-all six flag bits are set to zero
- '-sN'
- will not trigger any response when it reaches an open por
-lack of reply: open or firewall is blocking packet
-RST response packet: port is closed
-requires root previleges
eg: sudo nmap -sN [target IP]

2. Fin Scan
-sends TCP packet with the FIN flag set
-'-sF'
-doesn't know if port is open
-RST response: port is closed
-root previleges
eg: sudo nmap -sF [target IP]

3. Xmas Scan
-FIN, PSH and URG flags simultaneously
-'-sX'
-eg: sudo nmap -sX [target IP]
-efficient when scanning a target behind a stateless(non-stateful) firewall.

4. TCP Maimon Scan
-FIN, ACK bits are set, shoudl send an RST as response
-'-sM'
-most systems respond with RST regardless of TCP port is open or not
eg: sudo nmap -sM [target IP]

5. TCP ACK Scan
-ACK flag set
-'-sA'
-responds with RST regardless of the state of the port
-behaviour happens bc TCP packet with ACK flag set should be sent only in response to a received TCP packet
-shows which ports are not blocked by firewall
eg: sudo nmap -sA [target IP]

6. Window Scan
-Similar to ACK scan but it examines the TCP window field of the RST packets returned
-'-sW'
-reveal open port
eg: sudo nmap -sW [target IP]

7. Custom Scan
-set custom flags
-'--scanflags'
eg: sudo nmap --scanflags FLAGS [target IP]
ALL FLAGS: URGACKPSHRSTSYNFIN

Spoofing and Decoys
-scan target systems using soofed IP address and even a spoofed MAC address
eg: sudo nmap -S [spoofed IP] [target IP]
-reponse sent to the spoofed IP
-important for attacker to monitor the network traffic to analyze replies
1. attacker sends a packet with spoofed source IP address to the target machine
2. target machine replies to the spoofed IP address destination
3. attacker captures reply to analyze open ports
-specify network interfacing using -e
-explicitly disable ping scan -Pn
eg: nmap -e NET_INTERFACE -Pn -S SPOOFED_IP TARGET_IP
-if on the same subnet, abel to spoof MAC address (same Ethernet or Wifi network)
Decoy: make the scan appear to be coming from many IP addresses
-'-D'
eg: nmap -D DECOY1,ME,DECOY2 [target IP]
