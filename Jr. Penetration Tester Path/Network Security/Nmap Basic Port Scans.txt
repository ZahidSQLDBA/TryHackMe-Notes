-TCP port or UDP port is used to identify a network service running on the host
-HTTP server binds TCP port 80 by default - HTTP
-HTTP server supports SSL/TLS, TCP port 443 - HTTPS
-ports can be reconfigured

-open ports: service listening on that port
-closed ports: no service listening on that port

-firewall might block packets for an open port making it appear closed
-open: service is listening
-closed: no service is listening, port is accessible(reachable & not blocked by firewall or other programs)
-filtered: nmap cant determine if port is open or closed because it is not accessible (packets are blocked)
-unfiltered: nmap cannot determine if port is open or closed, port is accessible (ACK scan)
-open|filtered: nmap cannot determine if port is open or filtered
-closed|filtered: nmap cannot determine if port is closed or filtered

UDP port 53 - DNS
TCP port 22 - SSH
Nmap port states - 6

TCP flags
-TCP header is the first 24 bytes of a TCP segment
1. URG: urgent flag - incoming data is urgent - processed immediately without consideration
2. ACK: acknowledgement flag - acknowledgment number is significant - receipt of TCP segment
3. PSH: push flag - ask TCP to pass the data to the application promptly
4. RST: reset flag - reset the connection
5. SYN: synchronize flag - initiate TCP 3-way handshake
6. FIN: finished flag - sender has no more data to send
