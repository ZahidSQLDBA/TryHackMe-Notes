-Shells - used when interfacing with a Command Line Interface environment (CLI).
eg. bash or sh - linux, cmd.exe - windows
-remote server to gain command line access to server = reverse shell
-open up a port on server which is able to connect to in order to execute further commands = bind shell

Tools
-Netcat: 'swiss army knife' of networking
-banner grabbing, receive shells and connect to remote ports to bind shells
-unstable, easy to lose

-Socat: netcat on steroids
-more stable
-syntax is more difficult
-rarely installed by default

Metasploit- multi/handler
-auxiliary/multi/handler - metasploit framework like socat and netcat, used to receive reverse shells
-only way to interact with a meterpreter shell, easiest way to handle staged payloads
Msfvenom: gen payloads on the fly

Types of Shell
1. Reverse Shells - the target is forced to execute code from the attacking computer remotely.
-set up a listener to receive a connection
-good way to bypass firewall rules(prevent from connecting to arbitrary ports on target)
-need to configure attacker network to accept the shell

2. Bind Shells - code executed on the target is used to start a listener attached to a shell directly on the target
-connect to the port the code has oppened and obtain RCE
-may be prevented by firewalls protecting the target 
-does not require any network configuration

Interactive vs non-Interactive shells
-Interactive: Powershell, Bash, Zsh, sh or any other CLI env
-Interactive shells allow for interaction with programs after execution

-Non-Interactive: limited to using programs which do not require user interaction in order to run properly
-majority of simple reverse and bind shells are non-interactive, tricky exploit.

Netcat
-reverse shells
1. start a netcat listener using linux
'nc -lvnp <port-number>'
-l: listener
-v: verbose output
-n: not to resolve host names (use DNS)
-p: port specification ( use well-known port number 80, 443, 53 - get past firewall)

-bind shells: there is a listener already to be slected by attacker
'nc <target-ip> <chosen-port>'
