-------------------------------------------------------------------

Network Infrastructure
-enumeration of compromised machine is key to finding out what to do net
-VLAN - hosts within VLAN can only communicate with other hosts in the same VLAN network

Internal Networks
-subnetworks that are segmented and separated based on importance of the internal device
-share information faster and easier tools with in an organization
-use segmentation to control traffic, optimize performance and improve security posture

Demiliterized Zone (DMZ)
-edge of network that protects and adds an extra security layer to a corporation's internal LAN from untrusted traffic

Network Enumeration
-check TCP and UDP open ports
netstat -na
-ARP table - contains the IP and physical address of the computers
arp -a

Internal Network Services
-provides private and internal network communication access for internal network devices
-not accessible outside the network

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Active Directory
-Windows based directory service that stores and provides data objects to the internal network environment
-allows for centralized mangement of authentication and authorization
-contains: users, computers, printers etc
-details: job title, phone numbers, address, passwords, groups, permissions, etc

Domain Controller: windows server that provides AD services and controls entire domain
-encryption of user data
-control access to network
-enables resource access and sharing
-lot of high-value information

Organizational Units (OU's): containers within the AD domain with a hierarchical structure

AD objects: single user or group or hardware component

AD domains: collection of Microsoft components within an AD network

AD Forest: collection of domains that trust each other

AD Enum

-get all AD user accounts
Get-ADUser -Filter *
-LDAP hierarchical tree structure: find a user within AD environment
-CN: common name
-OU: organizational Unit Name
-DC: Domain component
Get-ADUser -Filter * -SearchBase "CN=Users,DC=THMREDTEAM,DC=COM"

Host Security Solution #1
-enumerate antivirus and security detection methods to remain undetected as possible and avoid detection

1. Antivirus Software
-monitor, detect and pervent malicious softawre from being executed in the host
-perform: background scanning, full system scanning, virus definitions
-detection techniques:
a. Signature-based: 
b. Heuristic-based:
c. Behavior-based:
