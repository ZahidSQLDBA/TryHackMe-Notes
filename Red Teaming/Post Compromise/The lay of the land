Post compromise enumeration

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Network Infrastructure
-enumeration of compromised machine is key to finding out what to do net
-VLAN - hosts within VLAN can only communicate with other hosts in the same VLAN network

Internal Networks
-subnetworks that are segmented and separated based on importance of the internal device
-share information faster and easier tools with in an organization
-use segmentation to control traffic, optimize performance and improve security posture

Demiliterized Zone (DMZ)
-edge of network that protects and adds an extra security layer to a corporation's internal LAN from untrusted traffic

Network Enumeration
-check TCP and UDP open ports
netstat -na
-ARP table - contains the IP and physical address of the computers
arp -a

Internal Network Services
-provides private and internal network communication access for internal network devices
-not accessible outside the network

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Active Directory
-Windows based directory service that stores and provides data objects to the internal network environment
-allows for centralized mangement of authentication and authorization
-contains: users, computers, printers etc
-details: job title, phone numbers, address, passwords, groups, permissions, etc

Domain Controller: windows server that provides AD services and controls entire domain
-encryption of user data
-control access to network
-enables resource access and sharing
-lot of high-value information

Organizational Units (OU's): containers within the AD domain with a hierarchical structure

AD objects: single user or group or hardware component

AD domains: collection of Microsoft components within an AD network

AD Forest: collection of domains that trust each other

AD Enum

-get all AD user accounts
Get-ADUser -Filter *
-LDAP hierarchical tree structure: find a user within AD environment
-CN: common name
-OU: organizational Unit Name
-DC: Domain component
Get-ADUser -Filter * -SearchBase "CN=Users,DC=THMREDTEAM,DC=COM"

Host Security Solution #1
-enumerate antivirus and security detection methods to remain undetected as possible and avoid detection

1. Antivirus Software
-monitor, detect and pervent malicious softawre from being executed in the host
-perform: background scanning, full system scanning, virus definitions
-detection techniques:
a. Signature-based: signature of malicious software is registered in database and antivirus scan checks signature if file being scanned matches a malicious signature
b. Heuristic-based: machine learning to decide if file is malicious or not
c. Behavior-based: relies on monitoring and examining the execution of applications to find abnormal behaviors

check if antivirus exists
wmic /namespace:\\root\securitycenter2 path antivirusproduct
Get-CimInstance -Namespace root/SecurityCenter2 -ClassName AntivirusProduct

2. Windows Defender
-preinstalled antivirus security tool
-uses various algorithms in detection
-Active: runs as primary antivirus protection and remediation
-Passive: 3rd party antivirus is installed
-Disable: diabled or uninstalled from the system

check state of windows defender
Get-Service WinDefend
Get-MpComputerStatus | select RealTimeProtectionEnabled

3. Host-based Firewall
-security tool installed and run on host machine that can prevent and block attack attempts
-control inbound and outbound traffic
-analyze traffic including packet analysis

Get-NetFirewallProfile | Format-Table Name, Enabled

-disable firewall in admin privileges
Set-NetFirewallProfile -Profile Domain, Public, Private -Enabled False

-see rules
Get-NetFirewallRule | select DisplayName, Enabled, Description

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Host Security Solution #2

Event Logging and Monitoring
Get-EventLog -List

Sysmon-gathering and logging events
-useful in trouble shooting

-check to see if 'Sysmon' is running:
Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.ProcessName -eq "Sysmon"}

-check services
Get-CimInstance win32_service -Filter "Description = 'System Monitor service'" # or Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -like "*sysm*"}

-check windows registry
reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WINEVT\Channels\Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational

Host-Based intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (HIDS/HIPS)
-HIDS detect suspicious activity
a. Signature-based: look at checksums and message authentication
b. Anomaly-based: unexpected activity, abnormal bandwidth, protocols and ports
-HIPS secure operating system - detection and prevention

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
-defend against malware and other threats
-Malware: virsuses, trojans, adware, keyloggers
-Exploit chains
-Ransomware

Network Security Solutions
1. Network Firewall
-packet-filtering
-proxy firewalls
-NAT firewalls
-Web Application firewalls

2. SIEM
-monitor and analyze events and track and log data in real time
-log management
-event analytics
-incident monitoring and security alerts
-compliance management
eg. Splunk
