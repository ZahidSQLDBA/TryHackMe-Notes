Abusing Processes
-Processes maintain and represent a program being executed
-processes have sub-components
Private Virtual Address Space -> Virtual memory addresses the process is allocated.
Executable Program -> Defines code and data stored in the virtual address space
Open Handles -> Defines handles to system resources accessible to the process
Security Context -> The access token defines the user, security groups, privileges, and other security information.
Process ID -> Unique numerical identifier of the process
Threads -> Section of a process scheduled for execution

Process Injection: injection of malicious code into a process through legitimate functionality or components
1. Process Hollowing: inject code into a suspended/hollowed target process
2. Thread Execution hijacking: inject code into suspended target thread
3. DLL injection: inject a DLL into process memory
4. PE injection: self-inject a PE image pointing to a malicious function into a target process

-search of task manager
-go to details > click User name
-find THM-Attacker
-look for PID of dllhost.exe: xxxx
cd \Desktop\Injectors
.\shellcode-injector.exe xxxx
flag: THM{1nj3c710n_15_fun!}
