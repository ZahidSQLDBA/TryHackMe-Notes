Abusing Processes
-Processes maintain and represent a program being executed
-processes have sub-components
Private Virtual Address Space -> Virtual memory addresses the process is allocated.
Executable Program -> Defines code and data stored in the virtual address space
Open Handles -> Defines handles to system resources accessible to the process
Security Context -> The access token defines the user, security groups, privileges, and other security information.
Process ID -> Unique numerical identifier of the process
Threads -> Section of a process scheduled for execution

Process Injection: injection of malicious code into a process through legitimate functionality or components
1. Process Hollowing: inject code into a suspended/hollowed target process
2. Thread Execution hijacking: inject code into suspended target thread
3. DLL injection: inject a DLL into process memory
4. PE injection: self-inject a PE image pointing to a malicious function into a target process

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hollowing
-inject an entire malicious file into a process
-unmapping the process and inject specific PE (Portable Executable)
-steps:
1. Create a target process in a suspended state
2. open a malicious image
3. unmap legitimate code from process memory
4. Allocate memory location for malicious code and write each section into the address space
5. set an entry point for the malicious code
6. take the taget process out of a suspended state

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

High-level thread hijacking
1.Locate and open a target process to control.
2.Allocate memory region for malicious code.
3.Write malicious code to allocated memory.
4.Identify the thread ID of the target thread to hijack.
5.Open the target thread.
6.Suspend the target thread.
7.Obtain the thread context.
8.Update the instruction pointer to the malicious code.
9.Rewrite the target thread context.
10.Resume the hijacked thread.
