AV - Antivirus
-host based security solution
-extra layer of security that aims to detect and prevent the execution and spread of malicious files in a target OS
-runs in real-time to monitor and check current and newly downloaded files
-decides if files are malicious using different techniques

-looks for malware with predefined malicious patterns or signatures
-malware can: gain access to target and steal/encrypt/destroy files, inject other malicious software or takeover machine

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR): security solution that provides real-time protection based on behavioral analytics
-checks file activities, memory, network connections, registry, processes, etc
-modern AV has EDR functionality

-first AV software - VirusScan used to remove a virus called "Brain" - John McAfee (PC antivirus vendor McAfee)

Antivirus Engines
-scanner: GUI or command prompt
-Detection techniques: signature based(pre-defined), heuristic(behavioral), dynamic detection
-Compressors and Archives: zip, TGZ, 7z, xar, rar etc
-PE parsing unpackers: unpack most known packers (upx, armadillo, ASPack etc), DLLs, Iconfiles, font files anc core dumps
-Emulators: monitor API calls, memory dumps, filesystem mods, log events, running processes, web requests in a controlled env

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AV static detection
-pattern matching techniques in detection such as checksums, bytecode/hex values, cypto hashes
-check against signatures considered malicious
-clamAV antivirus
-check files EICAR: test file for AV software

c:\Program Files\ClamAV\clamscan.exe c:\Users\thm\Desktop\Samples
-after checking against db
-detects backdoor 1 but doesn't detect backdoor 2
