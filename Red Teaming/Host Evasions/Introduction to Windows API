Subsystem and Hardware Interaction
-Programs need to access or modify windows subsystems or hardware (restricted)
-Win32 API library to interface between user-mode applications and the kernel
User-mode: No direct hardware access, access to "owned" memory locations
Kernel-mode: Direct hardware access, access entire physical memory
