Intro

-Red Team engagements
-Id main components and stakeholders
-Understand main differences b/n red teaming and other cybersecurity engagements

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vuln Assessments
-Goal is to identify security deficiencies and deployment of effective security measures to protect the network
-use of automated tools w/out exploiting vulnerabilities

Penetration Tests
-start by scanning for vulns
-Attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities found on each system
-conduct post-exploitation on compromised host
-focus remains in identifying vulns and protecting network and also show impact an attacker could have on network

APT (advanced persistent threats)
-regular pentesting is not enough
1. Pen tests are loud - not much effort in trying to go undetected
2. Non-technical attack vectors might be overlooked - such as social engineering
3. Relaxation of security mechanisms - some security mechanisms might be disabled or relaxed for pentesting to be effective
-APTs are highly skilled

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Red Team Engagements
-take role of red team to simulate real world adversary strategies to test blue team's ability to defend against the threat
-define flags (crown jewels) such as compromise a critical host or gain sensetive information
-considering several attack surfaces
1. Technical Infrastructure: technical vulns - stealth and evasion
2. Social Engineering: Target people through phishing campaigns, phone calls or social media
3. Physical Intrusion: using techniques such as lockpicking, RFID cloning
types of red team exercises
1. Full engagement: simulate an attacker
2. Assumed Breach: assuming attacker has already gained control over some assets
3. Table-top exercise: simulation of certain scenarios

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teams and Functions of an Engagement
1. Red: Offensive
2. Blue: Defensive
3. White: Referee
Roles
1. Red Team Lead: delegates, assitant lead and operators engagement assignments
2. Read Team Assistant Lead: assists in writing engagment plans and documentation, assist in overseeing operations and operators
3. Red Team Operator: executes assignments delegated by team leads

Engagement Structure
-Cyber Kill Chain
1. Recon -> 2. Weaponization -> 3. Delivery -> 4. Exploitation -> 5.Installation -> 6.Command and Control -> 7.Actions on Objectives
1.Reconnaissance -	Obtain information on the target	Harvesting emails, OSINT
2.Weaponization -	Combine the objective with an exploit. Commonly results in a deliverable payload.	Exploit with backdoor, malicious office document
3.Delivery -	How will the weaponized function be delivered to the target	Email, web, USB
4.Exploitation -	Exploit the target's system to execute code	MS17-010, Zero-Logon, etc.
5.Installation -	Install malware or other tooling	Mimikatz, Rubeus, etc.
6.Command & Control -	Control the compromised asset from a remote central controller	Empire, Cobalt Strike, etc.
7.Actions on Objectives -	Any end objectives: ransomware, data exfiltration, etc.	Conti, LockBit2.0, etc.
